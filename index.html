            <p>With a background in talent acquisition in the manufacturing and technical fields, and a continuing education in software development, I combine an eye for details in writing code with a diverse knowledge in research methods, troubleshooting, and collaborative problem-solving. Throughout my career, I have documented processes into Standard Operating Procedures and developed supporting templates, marketing tools, and reporting metrics to create a streamlined and uniform system that underscores my commitment to efficiency and excellence. My unique fusion of experience in talent acquisition and dedication to software development is supported by a comprehensive understanding of research methods. This academic grounding, combined with hands-on experience, empowers me to adopt a holistic approach to my work in software development. I am not just a coder; I am a dynamic problem solver who navigates challenges with the precision of academic rigor and the adaptability of practical experience. Armed with a solid foundation in research-oriented fields, I bring an invaluable perspective to software development and I am ready to contribute my skills to your endeavors, delivering impactful solutions that align with your organizationâ€™s goals.</p>
